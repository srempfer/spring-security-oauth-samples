# Spring Security OAuth2 Samples

This repository includes Sample Applications to show how to bring the different OAuth2 pieces together.

In the end of 2019 Spring Security [dropped](https://spring.io/blog/2019/11/14/spring-security-oauth-2-0-roadmap-update) 
the "Authorization Server Support". For that reason it's not longer out of the box compatible
with actual Spring Security OAuth2 Client support.
But there are good news: Spring [announced](https://spring.io/blog/2020/04/15/announcing-the-spring-authorization-server)
the community-driven Authorization Server project. The development is just at the beginning and so it's not foreseeable when 
the project will get out of the experimental state.

That's the situation we currently have in the Spring Security OAuth2 support.

Because of this a major part of the Authorization Server Samples are to show how to extend the old and loved 
Authorization Server support so that it works with the actual OAuth2 Client support together again.
